(hereinafter referred to as "the platform") as the owner of the official platform (including web end, mobile end and application program, hereinafter referred to as "the platform") for the cold wallet service and other related matters, which is legally binding on the user and the credit. In particular, we hereby remind you to carefully read and fully understand the terms of this agreement, especially the terms in this agreement related to the exemption or limitation of platform liability, as well as the terms of exclusion or restriction of user rights. The user shall carefully read and choose to accept or not to accept this agreement. Unless the user accepts all terms of this agreement, the user has no right to use the services provided by the platform based on this agreement. If the user disagrees with the content of this agreement or refuses to recognize the right of the platform to unilaterally modify this agreement at any time, the user shall immediately stop using and no longer access the platform. The user\'s use of the platform services (including but not limited to use, browsing, etc.) shall be deemed as full understanding and acceptance of all terms of this Agreement (including any modification made to this agreement from time to time by hixin), and this Agreement shall be established and take effect immediately.In addition to this agreement, users shall also abide by other agreements and rules publicized by the platform, including but not limited to use license agreement, privacy policy, after-sales service policy and legal statement, as well as other agreements, rules, announcements, statements, instructions or guidelines that have been published or may be published in the future on the platform (including as amended from time to time, as follows Collectively, the "rules").
        \n<font color="#000000"><b>Article 1 interpretation </b></font>
        \n 1.1  "Agreement" means this user service agreement, as amended from time to time.
        \n 1.2  "Cold wallet" refers to the hardware product that realizes the secure storage of digital assets based on the technical scheme of hierarchical deterministic (hd).Cold wallet uses two technical schemes to generate private keys of different currencies: one is to randomly generate seed passwords and set payment passwords, which jointly generate private keys of different currencies; the other is to randomly generate mnemonics, which generate private keys of different currencies.Finally, the private key generates the public key, and the public key generates the asset address to realize the secure storage of digital assets."
        \n 1.3  "Hot wallet" refers to the digital asset wallet developed based on the blockchain, including other auxiliary tools developed for the convenience of users to use the blockchain system.
        \n 1.4  The "public key" is generated by one-way derivation of the private key with the help of cryptography principle, and is used to generate the blockchain digital wallet address, which is the public collection address.
        \n 1.5  "Private key", composed of 256 random characters, is the key for users to own and use digital assets.
        \n 1.6  "Mnemonic words" refer to 12 (or 15 / 18 / 21 / 24) ordered words generated by random algorithm in line with the industry standard of blockchain bip39, which are easy to record forms of private keys and convenient for users to back up and keep.
        \n 1.7  "Payment password", during the process of creating wallet, the user should set password, which will be used to jointly generate currency private key with seed password. This password cannot be modified. Once the user loses or forgets this password, the asset will not be recovered.
        \n 1.8  "Security password", during the process of creating wallet, the user should set the password, which will be used to protect the private key. The security password is not stored in the user\'s mobile device or coin letter platform server. Once the user forgets the password, it cannot be retrieved. The user can import the new security password into the wallet again with the help of the private key or mnemonic words.
        \n<font color="#000000"><b>Article 2 platform services </b></font>
